# python-games

In this repository I am placing some "silly" Python games that one can play in their CMD

The games are:
1) Hangman ( 2 players, one puts the word and how many chances to guess and the other user guesses )
2) Guess the number ( 2 players guessing a random number - the number is randomly generater and you can change the range. Players can select the number of chances and the player that guessed the closest wins)
3) Calculate the correct number (this game has levels where their difficulty, no of calculations etc. can be configured in the script itself)
